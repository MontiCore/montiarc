## The MontiArc Architecture Description Language

<img src="pics/elevatorExample.PNG" alt="drawing" height="400px"/>

In MontiArc, architectures are described as component and connector systems in which autonomously acting components perform computations. Communication between components is regulated by connectors between the componentsâ€™ interfaces, which are stable and build up by typed, directed ports. Components are either atomic or composed of connected subcomponents. Atomic components yield behavior descriptions in the form of embedded time-synchronous port automata, or via integration of handcrafted code. For composed components the behavior emerges from the behavior of their subcomponents.
