| ☐     | FieldsInGuardsExist, FieldsInReactionsExist                                 | ArcAutomaton | Would fit as SC-Cocos, as they know symbols. However then we had to adapt ports as fields. Alternatively the CoCo could be design modular, allowing to hook own *NameResolver*s in which define, that something valid was found for a `NameExpression` (e.g., a port in the case of MontiArc). The \*InReactionsExist-Coco should be refactored to an \*InStatementsExist-Coco (if its definition in MontiArc is desired), so that it also checks InitialOutputDeclarations. The most clean way would be defining this coco as an Expression-CoCo. However the expression languages do not know symbols... |

With stereotypes present, we only warn the user. With all other unsupported modelling elements, we throw errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
