Multiple inital states are not forbidden by this coco. Btw. do we need to check this coco at all or is it caught by some coco checking that state names are unique?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ☐     | FieldsInGuardsExist, FieldsInReactionsExist                                 | ArcAutomaton       | Would fit as SC-Cocos, as they know symbols. However then we had to adapt ports as fields. Alternatively the CoCo could be design modular, allowing to hook own *NameResolver*s in which define, that something valid was found for a `NameExpression` (e.g., a port in the case of MontiArc). The \*InReactionsExist-Coco should be refactored to an \*InStatementsExist-Coco (if its definition in MontiArc is desired), so that it also checks InitialOutputDeclarations. The most clean way would be defining this coco as an Expression-CoCo. However the expression languages do not know symbols... |
| ☐     | OnlyAssignToNames, \[Prefix/Suffix\]\[Decrement/Increment\]TargetsNamesOnly | ArcAutomaton       | Checks that only NameExpressions/FieldAccessExpressions are incremented / decremented / value-assigned. This Coco would be nice in AssignmentExpressions, but they do not know symbols. Would also be nice in ArcBasis, but ArcBasis does not know AssignmentExpressions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
