<!-- (c) https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore -->
The purpose of this directory and it's contained models is to provide a valid directory structure and to have valid
models (content is irrelevant), so that we can test proper I/O behavior of the MontiArcTool methods that work on paths,
files, and directories (such as MontiArcTool#parse(String, Path)).
