MontiArc has a rich static type system to define the structure of data that 
flows through ports or is assignable to configuration paramaters, fields, 
or other behavioral entities.
These types are not definable within MontiArc itself.
Instead,

* inbuilt primitive types.
* richer object oriented types can be defined by using class-diagrams.
* moreover, one can use import java types.

Generics types are also supported as part of object oriented types.
